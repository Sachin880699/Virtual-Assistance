Using this option will send you a link at your secondary email account (which doesn\u2019t need to be Gmail), with a 6-digit code that will allow you to set up a new password and regain access to your account. Check your mail on this secondary account to see the code, then enter it to unlock a new password generator. Newer accounts may also have a phone number backup option\u2014see below. If that doesn\u2019t work\u2014like, say, you don\u2019t have access to the account that you originally designated as a backup either\u2014click \u201ctry a different question\u201d again.

                  "1.\nUnderstand the need for an antivirus program. Windows is the most virus-prone operating system (OS) out of the three major OSes. It has the most users and the weakest built-in security. Antivirus programs will defend your computer from malware that comes through email, flash drives, downloads, websites and more.\n2. \nAcquire an antivirus program. There are several popular free options available that do a good job of protecting the average user. These programs are updated frequently with new virus definitions that recognize the latest threats.[1]\nIf you frequently deal with files or websites that are virus-infected, you may want to opt for more powerful paid protection. Paid antivirus programs are typically available for a yearly subscription fee.\nWhen downloading free or paid antivirus programs, ensure that you are downloading from a trusted source. There are many programs out there that claim to be antivirus/antimalware but instead install malware themselves. Read reviews and download products from companies that have been around for a long time.[2]\nWindows 10 and 8 have Windows Defender, which is a free anti-malware application provided by Microsoft. It's already built-in.\n3. \nInstall the antivirus program. Make sure that no other programs are running while you install the antivirus. You will most likely need to be connected to the internet to download additional files and updates.\nSome free antivirus programs come packaged with toolbars for your web browser. These can add protection but also change your search options and bog down older computers. You have the opportunity to opt out of these changes during the installation process."

If you\u2019ve previously texted with someone using their phone number or if a person has shared their phone number with you in an email, a phone call from that number will go through.\nTo turn on Silence Unknown Callers, go to Settings > Phone, then scroll down, tap Silence Unknown Callers, and turn on the feature. Calls from unknown numbers are silenced and sent to your voicemail, and appear in your recent calls list.\nIncoming calls will come through from people that are saved in your contacts list, recent calls list, and from Siri Suggestions to let you know who\u2019s calling based on phone numbers included in your emails or text messages.\nIf an emergency call is placed, Silence Unknown Callers will be temporarily disabled for the next 24 hours to allow for your iPhone to be reached.\nBefore you turn on Silence Unknown Callers, make sure you have important contacts saved or you could miss a phone call that you don\u2019t want to miss. The call will still go to voicemail and appear in your recent calls list, but you won\u2019t get a notification while the call is ringing.\n\n3. Set up an app to filter and detect spam calls\nGo to the App Store and download an app that detects and blocks spam phone calls. You can download and install multiple apps with this feature from different app developers.\nGo to Settings > Phone.\nTap Call Blocking & Identification.\nUnder Allow These Apps To Block Calls And Provide Caller ID, turn the app on or off. You can also reorder the apps based on priority. Just tap Edit and then drag the apps in the order you want them.\n\nPhone numbers that appear under Blocked Contacts are numbers that you manually block."

Always protect your home wireless network with a password. When connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, be cautious about what information you are sending over it.\nShop safely.

            "responses": [
                  "1. Reconnect the mouse. Before doing anything, make sure the issue isn't a temporary one. You can do this by disconnecting the mouse from the USB port and plugging it back in. Whenever you plug in a mouse, it restarts the mouse drivers and this alone could resolve the issue. You might even try using a different USB port. If you're using a wireless mouse, make sure you've connected it properly to your PC.\n2. Replace the batteries. If you're using a wireless mouse, low battery power is the most common cause of strange mouse behavior. Whether the mouse wheel isn't scrolling or the mouse is otherwise acting erratically, swapping the batteries is a very quick and inexpensive way to rule out this cause.\n3. You might also consider switching to rechargeable batteries so that you can always have fully charged batteries on hand that you swap out on a schedule. This way you don't have to wait until your mouse starts acting up before changing them.\n4. Clean the mouse. Most modern mice don't have rollers to clean anymore, but now the scroll wheel is the one mechanical part. This also means it's the part prone to attracting dirt, dust, and food particles. These slip in through the cracks on the side of the wheel and can lead to the mouse scroll wheel not working. If your mouse is wireless, there are some special wireless mouse cleaning considerations to keep in mind.\n5. Check the touchpad. Another common issue is mouse interference from something touching the touchpad on your laptop. This could be something as simple as water leaking from a cup nearby. You might even consider temporarily disabling your touchpad just to see if this fixes the problem.\n6. Check mouse wheel settings. Each OS has unique settings to control the mouse wheel. If these change you could experience the mouse wheel not scrolling. Look through your mouse settings on your Windows 10 to ensure wheel scrolling is actually enabled and configured properly.\n7. Update mouse drivers. The most effective way to update your mouse driver is to download and install the latest mouse driver from the manufacturer's website. On a Windows 10 PC, check the Device Manager to ensure there isn't an exclamation mark next to the mouse driver after you've updated. If there is, you'll want to roll back the mouse driver and try something else.\nNote: Before moving on to the final step, try using a different mouse to make sure that the issue is actually with your system and not a mouse hardware failure. You wouldn't want to take more drastic measures with your computer if all you need is to buy a new mouse.\n8. Fix corrupt system files. At this point, it is possible your system files may be corrupt. Before you try anything drastic, make sure you've installed the latest system updates for Windows 10. Next, try to perform an automatic repair for Windows 10. If all else fails, you may need to do a full Windows 10 system restore or a clean install of Windows if you don't have a recovery backup."

                  "Tap Crumbs Loose, but Don\u2019t Shake Your Laptop\nYou can remove some crumbs and other debris by gently turning your laptop over and lightly tapping it. Don\u2019t shake it or you could damage some of your computer\u2019s hardware. Solid-state laptops and stand-alone keyboards are more durable, but that\u2019s no green light for an earthquake-level shake down. For a less-risky crumb removal (or after the initial shake), try using the sticky end of a Post-it note on the hard-to-remove specks or a piece of adhesive tape.\n\nGet Some Air\nCanned air or dust removal spray \u2014 available at office supply stores, general retail stores and even auto parts dealers \u2013 is your top quick-cleaning agent. Used with a micro-straw-like dispenser, you\u2019ll be able to easily (and carefully!) blow debris and dust out from between your keys for removal. Remember to keep the canister at less than a 40-degree angle, pointed down toward the keyboard, or you\u2019ll end up discharging refrigerant.\n\nTry a Dust Vac to Clean Keyboard\nAfter you\u2019ve blown the dust and debris to one spot \u2014 or if you don\u2019t happen to have any canned air \u2014 use a hand vac with a narrow dust attachment to suck up the undesirables. If you\u2019re using a stand-alone keyboard, make sure none of your keys are loose, or you could be hunting for a lost letter inside your dust vac\u2019s filter. For better results, buy a USB vacuum cleaner that plugs directly into a USB port and comes with a thin keyboard cleaning attachment.\n\nFor Caked-On Grime, Use Screen Wipes\nApply gentle pressure to wrest globs of gunk from your keys. Don\u2019t overdo it, or you risk actually peeling the characters off the keys (unless you\u2019re using an older keyboard with burnished characters). You can also use a topical cleaner, but spray it onto a soft cloth or paper towel and then clean your keys. Do not spray the cleaner directly onto the keyboard.\n\nUse Cotton Swabs between the Keys\nThese can be dry or lightly moistened with a gentle cleaner. Wipe carefully and slowly between the keys, and across the tops and bottoms, to remove excess dust.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to run through this cleaning ritual every 1 to 3 months. If you use more than one keyboard regularly, remember to clean all of them. And of course, always check your owner\u2019s manual for model-specific keyboard cleaning instructions.\n\nA Few Cleaning Don\u2019ts\n- Don\u2019t try to remove keys from the keyboard to wash them by hand \u2014 especially if you\u2019re using a laptop. Some machines have keys that are designed to be removed for cleaning, but most do not.\n- Don\u2019t put your stand-alone keyboard in the dishwasher. Some technicians swear by this method, and your keyboard might live to type another day. Odds are, however, you\u2019ll kill it and have to buy another one. (And if that\u2019s the case, why clean it anyway?)\n- Don\u2019t put your laptop in the dishwasher or washing machine in an attempt to clean the keys \u2014 unless you really want to lose your data and have to buy another machine.\n- Don\u2019t try to dry off a wet keyboard in the clothes dryer, or in the oven \u2014 unless you\u2019re bored with the keyboard\u2019s desk-friendly, flat shape.\n- Don\u2019t try to clean the keyboard using steel wool, cleaning sponges or spray-on lime and calcium removers \u2014 unless you plan to test your memory once all the letters come off the keys.\n- Don\u2019t forget to turn your computer off before attempting to clean a keyboard. Today\u2019s machines are just as prone to pressure- and moisture-induced mechanical errors as their 5- or even 10-year-old ancestors were."

                  "1. Open Start Image titled Windowsstart.png. Click the Windows logo in the bottom-left corner of the screen.\n2. Open System Information. Type msinfo into the Start window, then click System Information at the top of the Start window.\n3. Check your computer's model name. Next to the \"System Model\" heading, you'll see a list of numbers and letters; this is your computer's model name. You'll need this information when you search for the BIOS update file.\n-Skip this step if you have a custom-built computer. \n4. Find your BIOS version number. Next to the \"BIOS Version/Date\" heading, you'll see a company name, your computer's model name, and a number after a period. The number after the period is your BIOS version.\nFor a computer with the model number \"Q553UB\" and a BIOS set to version 202, for example, you would see \"Q553UB.202\" here.\nIf you're using a custom-built computer, you'll need to find your motherboard's model instead of using the computer's model number. \n5. Open your BIOS manufacturer's support site. Generally, the easiest way to do this is by typing your computer's manufacturer name, your computer's model name, and \"drivers\" or \"BIOS\" into Google and then selecting the proper link. This process will vary depending on your computer's manufacturer, so you may have to click through a few different links before you find the correct one.\nIf you're using a custom-built computer, you'll need to look up your computer's motherboard name along with \"BIOS\" and \"update\" and then open the manufacturer's website. \n6. Find the BIOS update file. Depending on the website, you may have to open the \"Updates\", \"Support\", or \"Downloads\" section first, or click a \"BIOS\" heading. Once you've found the BIOS file, you can proceed.\nAgain, this may involve some trial and error. \n7. Make sure the update file is newer than your BIOS version. In the file's name, you should see a version number. If this version number is higher than your BIOS version number, your BIOS is outdated and thus can be updated.\nIf the version number on the website matches your BIOS version number, your BIOS is up-to-date and does not need updating.\nEven if your current BIOS version is a whole number (e.g., 301) and the file on the site is listed as a higher decimal (e.g., 301.1), the site's file is a higher version than your BIOS uses. \n8. Download the update file. Click the Download link, button, or icon to do so. Once your BIOS update file finishes downloading, you can proceed with updating your BIOS.\nIn some cases, you may have to click the file's name to prompt it to download.\nMost BIOS update files will download inside of a ZIP folder. \n9. Make sure your computer is plugged into a reliable power source. Since you can permanently ruin your BIOS if your computer turns itself off during the update process, you'll want to use a reliable power source.\nIf you're using a laptop, your computer's battery should be fully charged in addition to the laptop being plugged in. \n10. Extract your BIOS file. In most cases, you'll have to extract (or \"unzip\") the BIOS update file from within its folder:\nDouble-click the downloaded ZIP file to open it.\nClick the Extract tab at the top of the window.\nClick Extract all.\nClick Extract when prompted.\nWait for the extracted folder to open. \n11. Read your BIOS file's README document if applicable. If a text document labeled \"README\" or similar is available, double-click it to open it and read the entire document before proceeding.\nIf the README file's instructions for updating your BIOS contradict the instructions in the rest of this article, make sure you follow the README's instructions instead. \n12. Plug a USB flash drive into your computer. Since your BIOS won't be able to access your computer's files, you'll need to put the BIOS update file on a blank USB flash drive \n13. Copy the BIOS file onto the flash drive. Click once the BIOS file, press Ctrl+C to copy it, then open your flash drive and press Ctrl+V to paste in your copied file.\nYou need to leave the flash drive plugged into your computer for the duration of the update process. \n6. Access the BIOS page. Prompt your computer to restart by clicking Start Image titled Windowsstart.png, clicking Power Image titled Windowspower.png, and clicking Restart, then immediately begin pressing the key your computer's manufacturer assigned to the BIOS startup. If the BIOS doesn't launch, you'll need to restart again and try a different key.\nFor most computers, this key is one of the function keys (e.g., F12), though some computers use the Del key or the Esc key.\nIf you don't know your computer's BIOS key, look it up by typing your computer's manufacturer name, model name, and \"BIOS key\" into a search engine. \n14. Back up your BIOS if possible. If you see a \"Backup\" or \"Save\" option on the BIOS' main screen (or if you see a Backup tab at the top of the screen), select it and follow any on-screen instructions. This will ensure that you can restore your BIOS settings later if your BIOS update doesn't pair well with your computer.\nYou may instead be prompted to back up your BIOS once you initiate the backup process.\nNot all BIOS pages allow you to back up their settings. \n15. Enable and use your BIOS update tool. Each BIOS will have a slightly different way of accessing the BIOS update tool, so you may have to consult your BIOS manufacturer's support site for a direct explanation of how to do so.\nIn many cases, you'll select the Boot tab, ensure that your USB flash drive shows up, enable any backup or \"Flash\" options in the menu, and then select the Start Flash option from the Advanced tab.[1]\nSometimes, pressing the BIOS key while a USB drive is plugged in will bring up a unique menu that allows you to select an Update option and follow the on-screen instructions. This is common on Dell computers.[2] \n16. Allow your computer's BIOS to update. This process can take a few minutes to over an hour depending on your computer and the depth of the BIOS update. Once your BIOS is finished updating, your computer should restart itself, though you may be prompted to confirm this decision.\nDo not turn off your computer while the BIOS is updating. Doing so can cause the BIOS to become corrupted, meaning that your computer will be unable to start, complete the BIOS installation, or otherwise run at all."

A pop-up window may ask for permission to make changes to your device; say yes. 2. The blue PowerShell command window will appear, allowing you to enter commands to automate certain tasks within Windows 10. Type or paste powercfg /batteryreport /output \"C:\\battery-report.html\" into the window and press Enter to run the command. 3. PowerShell will then tell you the name of the generated battery life report HTML file and where it has been saved on your computer. In this case, it is called battery-report.html and it has been saved to the C drive. You can now safely close PowerShell. 4. Open Windows File Explorer and access the C drive. There you should find the battery life report saved as an HTML file. Double-click the file to open it in your preferred web browser. 5. The report will outline the health of your laptop battery, how well it has been doing, and how much longer it might last. At the top of the Battery Report, you will see basic information about your computer, followed by the battery's specs."
